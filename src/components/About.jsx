        Cheerleading in the UK is becoming more and more popular each year. To
        compensate for this, more competitions and more teams are becoming
        available. As a result, there is so much information flying around and
        it is never all in one place. Therefore, I have trolled through lots of
        different websites, Facebook pages, Instagram pages, and more, to
        provide a website that has all current information so that it is easily
        accessible for everyone.
